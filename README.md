 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1


For my prototype I wanted to make a snake game. Similar to rollaball but the snake obviously needs to be in perpetual motion. After collecting a drop, the snake will grow. Upon the snake colliding with the walls, the game ends and the player has to start over.
